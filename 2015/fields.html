	<h1>Fields</h1>
</div>

<p>There are a few rules to follow at our field site. Please respect these rules so that we can continue to use this wonderful beach for OLOB.
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">No alcohol</span>. In past years, police have stopped by to check, and some players have been fined. Getting caught with alcohol puts our tournament in jeopardy. Please don't do it.
<li>No amplified music, except by battery power. We're looking at you, ROCKtopus!
<li>No dogs.
<li>No glass. For everyone's safety.
<li>The southern end of the point is a protected area. Please keep out!
<li>Do not park illegally. Mainly, don't block anyone in. There is overflow parking in the paved lot to the northwest.
</ul>
