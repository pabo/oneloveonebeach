	<h1>One Love One Beach 2016</h1>
	<h5>San Diego's 15th annual mixed beach ultimate tournament</h5>
</div>

<p>One Love One Beach is a 24-team, mixed 4v4 beach charity tournament in Mission Beach, San Diego.

<p><h3>The 15th annual(!) OLOB was held April 16-17, 2016.</h3>

<p>As always, OLOB proceeds go to the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>. Since 2002, we've <span class='highlight'>donated over $20,000</span> to this cause. We encourage you to donate and invite your teammates to donate as well, either online or in person at the tournament.

<p><h3>A note from the TD:</h3>
Thanks to team and individual donations, we were able to meet last year's record breaking donation amount despite having 5 fewer teams!  That's right, once again, DUDE is proud to announce that we have donated $3,000 to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society!

<p>A special thank you to <b>No Pants Party, O'Lobsters, Sandy Again, and Off in the Sand</b> for going so far above and beyond, that I am nearly speechless.  I am just very grateful on behalf of LLS that each of your teams nearly doubled the amount expected, raising between $450 and $600!  Also note that I was not able to break down by team the amount raised by sales of merchandise, so if you and/or your team contributed in that manner, thank you for that.

<p>Please forward this email to your team members, as I want them all to know how much they contributed to the great cause of LLS.

<p>Finally, if you have any complaints, comments, or suggestions on OLOB, please let me know so I can make next year even better.
<p> - Keith Temple, OLOB TD

<!-- <p class="small">*DUDE and OLOB don't make a dime from this tournament -- this ain't no Lei Out. After covering the tournament costs, we donate 100% of the remaining money to the LLS. $250 is one of the lowest tournament fees around and the more you donate, the more goes to LLS. However, if your team can't spare the suggested donation we will <i>not</i> deny your bid based solely on that. Just send us your sob story and we'll figure something out.

<p>Don't have a team? Need more ladies? Need more dudes? (what?!) Head over to the <a href="pickup.html">pickup page</a> to humblebrag. Maybe you'll get picked up.
