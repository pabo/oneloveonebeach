<p>OLOB donates a substantial portion of its proceeds to the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia & Lymphoma Society</a>. <span class="highlight">Over the past 15 years, we have raised more than $20,000</span> for this cause. We encourage you to make your own donation at their website.
<p>Mariner's point, our field site, is a nesting site for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Least_Tern">California Least Tern</a>. The Least Tern is an endangered species whose numbers have been recovering from only 582 breeding pairs in 1974. OLOB takes place in the middle of the breeding season, and so it is very important that we do not disturb their nesting sites, located at the southern end of Mariner's Point.
<p>OLOB is run as a partnership with the local Ultimate organization, <a href="http://dudeultimate.com/">Diego Ultimate Disc Experience</a>. DUDE runs many leagues and events in San Diego throughout the year.
