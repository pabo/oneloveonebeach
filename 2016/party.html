<p>This year's party is in the same dank ass dive bar as the last three years: <a href="http://www.pennantbar.com/">The Pennant</a> in Mission Beach. Look at the map. The shortest way to get there from the fields is literally to <b>swim</b> there. Not that we'd suggest anything like that...
<ul>
	<li>You <i>will need</i> wristbands to use the bar tab. Captains, don't leave the fields Saturday without wristbands for your team. If you failed to report your scores to Tournament Central, you may report your scores via text message to 619-885-0280.
<li>The party is 21+ (sorry, young'uns) and you can NOT bring outside alcohol. It's a bar.
<li>The bar tab opens at 9:00pm and goes until we run out of money. Once you're buying your own drinks, it is <span class="highlight">cash only</a>.
<li>There will be a photo booth available from 9:30-11:30, so make sure you look fabulous!
<li>The bar closes at 2am.
<li>Street parking outside the bar is scarce. Park just north of the bar in the public lot marked on the map. This lot is open until 2am but you will <i>probably</i> not get ticketed, towed, or blocked in if your car is left there after 2.
<li>Remember, friends don't let friends drink and drive (or <b>swim</b>) home.
</ul>
