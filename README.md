This is the website for an ultimate frisbee tournament in San Diego.

Templates
---------
I'm using a super simple templating system - SSI with perl CGI.

Each .html file should start with
    <!--#include virtual="cgi-bin/header?title" -->
where `title` is the page title.

And end with
    <!--#include virtual="cgi-bin/footer" -->
