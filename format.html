<p>OLOB is a 4v4 beach tournament. We follow <a href="http://beachultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Appendix-WFDF-2013-Rules-BULA-4-on-4-Rules.pdf">BULA 4v4 rules</a>. Here's a quick refresher of the rules you might need clarified:
<ul>
<li> Fields are 8/34/8 yards long x 30 yards wide.
<li> Pulls must be inverted (at least 1 degree from vertical when landing).
<li> After an out-of-bounds pull, the pivot must be established either (1) where the disc went out-of-bounds or (2) at the brick mark.
<li> The brick mark is 8 yards in front of the goal line (the same distance as the depth of the end zone).
<li> Six second stall count. Generally, a stall cannot come in at higher than 5. On a contested call, the stall cannot come in higher than 4.
<li> One timeout per team per half. Timeouts last 60 seconds.
<li> Endzone to endzone is two points; pivot foot must be in goal or on goal line.
<li> Sidelines and back end zone line are out of bounds. Front end zone line is not a goal.
<li> Two guys and two girls on the field at all times.
<li> NO foot blocks. Any attempted footblock is a foul, regardless of whether it affected the throw.
</ul>
