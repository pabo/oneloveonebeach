	<h1>One Love One Beach 2016</h1>
	<h5>San Diego's 15th annual mixed beach ultimate tournament</h5>
</div>

<p>One Love One Beach is a 24-team, mixed 4v4 beach charity tournament in Mission Beach, San Diego.

<p><h3>The 16th annual OLOB will be April 1 - 2, 2017.</h3>

<p>Help us celebrate <span class='highlight'>OLOB's Sweet 16 Party</span>. The hardest part to throwing a party is picking the theme, so each team will bring its own party theme to the fields. No duplicate themes allowed!

<p>As always, OLOB proceeds go to the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>. Since 2002, we've <span class='highlight'>donated over $23,000</span> to this cause. We encourage you to donate and invite your teammates to donate as well, either online or in person at the tournament.

<p>Thanks to team and individual donations last year, DUDE proudly donated another $3,000 to LLS! A special thank you goes to <b>No Pants Party, O'Lobsters, Sandy Again, and Off in the Sand</b> for going so far above and beyond in their donations.

<p>Please join us this year in raising funds for the worthy cause of LLS and in celebrating 16 years of OLOB!

<p><h3>Special uniform offer!</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.clubjr.com/english.html">CLUB Jr.</a> is the official uniform sponsor of OLOB 2017, and they have a special offer for the first 10 teams who place orders (deadline is February 17th). For our event, they have lowered the minimum number of items per order to 10 and offer a 5% discount for any full sublimated item (5% of these sales will be donated to LLS). Plus, if you can wait to pick up your order at the tourney, you can save even more (the fixed shipped charge would be $2 per item, instead of the usual $3-4). Just mention One Love One Beach when you order. Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:s-ishii@clubjr.com">Sat</a> with questions.

<p><h3>One more thing</h3>

If you're interested in helping run this tournament or any other <a href="http://dudeultimate.com">DUDE</a> events, please <a href="mailto:volunteer@dudeultimate.com">let us know</a>.
