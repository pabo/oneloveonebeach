	<h5>San Diego's 14th annual mixed beach ultimate tournament</h5>
</div>

<p>OLOB 2015 was a huge success!

<p>As always, OLOB proceeds go to the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>. In 2015 we made our largest donation ever of $3,000. We want to thank the efforts of our TD, Alisha Stoun, as well as the teams whose bid donations went <b>above and beyond</b> our suggested $250 donation.

<p>Thanks again to:
<ul>
	<li>Risky Bidness of Phoenix, Arizona
	<li>O'Lobsters of SoCal
	<li>Love Yourself of San Diego, CA
</ul>

<p>Since 2002, we've donated over $20,000 to this cause. We encourage you to donate on your own!

<!-- <p class="small">*DUDE and OLOB don't make a dime from this tournament -- this ain't no Lei Out. After covering the tournament costs, we donate 100% of the remaining money to the LLS. $250 is one of the lowest tournament fees around and the more you donate, the more goes to LLS. However, if your team can't spare the suggested donation we will <i>not</i> deny your bid based solely on that. Just send us your sob story and we'll figure something out.

<p>Don't have a team? Need more ladies? Need more dudes? (what?!) Head over to the <a href="pickup.html">pickup page</a> to humblebrag. Maybe you'll get picked up.
