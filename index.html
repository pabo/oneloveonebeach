	<h1>One Love One Beach 2016</h1>
	<h5>San Diego's 15th annual mixed beach ultimate tournament</h5>
</div>

<p>One Love One Beach is a 24-team, mixed 4v4 beach charity tournament in Mission Beach, San Diego. We're announcing the dates early this year to give you time to get your teams and bids together.

<p><h3>The 15th annual(!) OLOB will be held April 16-17, 2016.</h3>

<p>As always, OLOB proceeds go to the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>. Since 2002, we've <span class='highlight'>donated over $20,000</span> to this cause. We encourage you to donate and invite your teammates to donate as well, either online or in person at the tournament.

<p>Last year, we had our most successful fundraising year yet. We'd like to thank three teams and their captains that went <b>above and beyond</b> our suggested donation to make this possible:
<ul>
	<li>Will Gander, <i><b>Risky Bidness</b></i> (Phoenix, AZ)
	<li>Darin Woolpert, <i><b>O'Lobsters</b></i> (SoCal)
	<li>Brett Schellenberg, <i><b>Love Yourself</b></i> (San Diego, CA)
</ul>

<p><h3>Registration is <b>open.</b></h3>
<p>Our 24-team tournament fills up quickly. <a href="http://dudeultimate.com/e/one-love-one-beach-2016">Register now!</a>

<!-- <p class="small">*DUDE and OLOB don't make a dime from this tournament -- this ain't no Lei Out. After covering the tournament costs, we donate 100% of the remaining money to the LLS. $250 is one of the lowest tournament fees around and the more you donate, the more goes to LLS. However, if your team can't spare the suggested donation we will <i>not</i> deny your bid based solely on that. Just send us your sob story and we'll figure something out.

<p>Don't have a team? Need more ladies? Need more dudes? (what?!) Head over to the <a href="pickup.html">pickup page</a> to humblebrag. Maybe you'll get picked up.
