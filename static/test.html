<h1 class="centered short">Welcome to One Love One Beach</h1>
<p class="centered short">San Diego's 14th annual mixed beach ultimate tournament</p>
</div>



<p>OLOB is <b>back</b> and <b>later than ever</b>!

<p>The tournament will be held April 18-19, 2015 on Mission Bay. 

<p>As always, OLOB proceeds go to the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>. Since 2002, we've donated over $15,000 to this cause. We encourage you to donate and invite your teammates to donate as well, either online or in person at the tournament.

<p>This year, our tournament coincides with an AUDL game (<a href="http://www.sdgrowlers.com/">San Diego Growlers</a> vs. <a href="http://www.laaviators.com/">Los Angeles Aviators</a>). All weekend you can play and watch as much ultimate as you can handle! We'll send out the details once they are finalized.

<p>Registration is open <b>now</b> and the 24-team tournament fills up quickly, so send in your bids ASAP. To register:
<ol>
	<li>Go read <a href="fields.html">the field rules</a>. Really. We'll wait right here.
	<li>Email <a href="mailto:oneloveonebeach@gmail.com?subject=OLOB+2015+bid">oneloveonebeach@gmail.com</a> with the following info:
	<ul>
		<li>team name, location
		<li>captain's name, email address, and phone number
		<li>seeding request (1 is highest, 24 is lowest)
		<li>team history, including past OLOB's attended and results
		<li>inspirational quote
	</ul>
	<li>Paypal us (suggested donation is $250*) at <a href="mailto:dudeultimate@gmail.com">dudeultimate@gmail.com</a>. If your bid is not accepted, we will refund your full bid fee promptly.
	<li>After you submit your bid, keep an eye on <a href="teams.html">the list of accepted bids</a>.
</ol>


<p class="small">*DUDE and OLOB don't make a dime from this tournament -- this ain't no Lei Out. After covering the tournament costs, we donate 100% of the remaining money to the LLS. $250 is one of the lowest tournament fees around and the more you donate, the more goes to LLS. However, if your team can't spare the suggested donation we will <i>not</i> deny your bid based solely on that. Just send us your sob story and we'll figure something out.

<p>Don't have a team? Need more ladies? Need more dudes? (what?!) Head over to the <a href="discussions.html">discussion page</a> to humblebrag. Maybe you'll get picked up.
